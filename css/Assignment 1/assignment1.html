                <p><strong>The Earth's</strong> oceans are all connected to one another. Until the year 2000, there were
                    four
                    recognized oceans: the
                    Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic. In the Spring of 2000, the International Hydrographic
                    Organization
                    delimited a new ocean, the Southern Ocean (it surrounds Antarctica and extends to 60 degrees
                    latitude).

                    There are also many seas (smaller branches of an ocean); seas are often partly enclosed by land. The
                    largest
                    seas are the South China Sea, the Caribbean Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea.

            <p>
                The biggest lesson from the first Earth Day: When we come together,
                the impact can be monumental. Go green with us by making small changes that add up to making a big
                difference.
                Commit to earth-friendly acts, make more sustainable choices, reduce your carbon footprint, conserve
                energy and resources,
                collaborate on environmental projects in your community, vote for leaders committed to protect us and
                the environment,
                and share your acts of green to help educate and inspire others to join our movement!
                Start protecting our environment today and help us create a healthy, more sustainable future.
