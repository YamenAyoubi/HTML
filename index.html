    <p><strong>The Earth's</strong> oceans are all connected to one another. Until the year 2000, there were four recognized oceans: the
        Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic. In the Spring of 2000, the International Hydrographic Organization
        delimited a new ocean, the Southern Ocean (it surrounds Antarctica and extends to 60 degrees latitude).

        There are also many seas (smaller branches of an ocean); seas are often partly enclosed by land. The largest
        seas are the South China Sea, the Caribbean Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
